Simplified models for gas exchange for lungs of human body Respiratory system


# Project Objective:
A hierarchy of models for gas exchange in the human lungs is presented in our research. our study is concerned with the interactions via the gas exchange process. A hierarchy of very simple models for gas exchange in the human lungs is presented in this study. In humans, complex connections between the respiratory system and cardiac output have been discovered in several experiments. The models presented in this study may be thought of as a controlled system, and they give a mathematical foundation for connecting molecular-level and systems-level models. The effect of modifications in the molecular level on the alveolar partial pressure is illustrated. In addition, validating numerical simulations of the flexible lung model with gas exchange. Identifying methods we used in this model, using OpenCOR tool and finding results for our models. In this work, the gas exchange process is referred to as a controlled system. Numerical results are consistent with published experimental observations.


# Methdology
In our method section, we build a model of the gas exchange in human lungs that allows the the interactions via the gas exchange process. First, we chose the system then select the research paper we want to work on and our paper ides. After that, we build a mathematical model using OpenCOR to achieve our results. A hierarchy of very simple models for gas exchange in the human lungs is presented in our study.
Note: "This CellML model runs in both PCEnv and COR."

# Results
Our findings are used to validate the models, while others are used to demonstrate the benefits of moving between models, and still others give new information on the physiological system.

Figure Shows: that every heartbeat, the blood partial pressure readings are changed.

Figure Shows: a "moving" conveyor. (a) Every heartbeat, the blood partial pressure readings are re-initialized. (b) To determine the solutions at the end of the pulmonary capillaries, a sample of the solution is taken at the conclusion of each inter-beat interval.

Figure Shows: that We use the flexible lung model with gas exchange when, (a) Oxygen partial pressure in the alveoli. (b) Carbon dioxide partial pressure in the lobes. the convergence time towards steady-state solutions is longer but the results do not change qualitatively).

## Conclusion
A hierarchy of very simple models for gas exchange in the human lungs is presented in this study. By using, mathematical as a dynamic process in which basic and detailed models are applied forwards and backwards on a continually. The relationships between the models in this paper have been established. The idea that simplified models are simpler to understand and provide insight to the system. This study makes a number of assumptions, one of which is that the process of oxygen binding to hemoglobin is close to equilibrium. The fact that the models in our paper may be simplified to simpler models and known models was used to both analytically and quantitatively validate the models.

## Future Work & Suggestions
In Future work, the models in our paper can be connected to more complicated lung models. For example, a three-dimensional model of the conducting airways might be linked to the models in this research. Gas exchange is regarded in our study as the controlled system, While studying the controlled system can provide some insight into the cardio-respiratory system, the control and feedback mechanisms are important for understanding synchronization and Cheyne–Stokes’s respiration and will be covered in the future.
